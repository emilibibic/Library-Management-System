# Library-Management-System

A simple, modular, object-oriented program for managing a small library’s book inventory.  
This project demonstrates user-defined functions, modular programming (multiple files), and a `Book` class with encapsulation.

# Files
- book.py — Defines the `Book` class with `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `__str__`, and `get_details()`.
- library_manager.py — Main program: menu loop plus functions `add_book`, `list_books`, and `find_book`.

# How to Run
1. Ensure both `book.py` and `library_manager.py` are in the same folder.
2. In a terminal:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py
